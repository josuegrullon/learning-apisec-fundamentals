Brief:

<i> APIs have become the primary target for attackers because they serve as a central access point to sensitive data and functionality, often being over-permissioned and easier to exploit than traditional cyber attacks while potentially exposing millions of records through a single vulnerability.</i>


- 83% of all internet traffic comes from APIs
- From 2022 APIs are the most common attack vector


### Why attackers target apis?
- Direct access to sensitive data
    - Lead to massive data breaches (examples):

    - Experian: Credit records exposed
    - Bumble: 100 million users exposed
    - LinkedIn: All user information harvested
    - Venmo: 200 million transactions exposed
- Over permissined
- Vulnerable to logic flaws

Classic  cyberattack cycle:

Regulatory Compliance:
Must balance three competing needs:
- Security
    - Web applications
    - Vulnerabilities testing
    - Rapid Resolution
- Privacy
    - Protection of the user data
- Accesibility
    - Make data enough accessible
    - Information blocking penalties

<strong>Ubiquitous</strong> means "present, appearing, or found everywhere" or "existing or being everywhere at the same time."
In the context of APIs, when we say they are ubiquitous, it means APIs are:

Present everywhere in modern technology
Used in almost all digital interactions
Found across different types of applications and services
Widespread and commonplace in our daily digital experiences
